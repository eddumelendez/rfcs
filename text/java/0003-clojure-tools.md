# Clojure Tools Buildpack

## Summary

A Clojure Tools buildpack for building Clojure applications using [deps][d] and [tools build][t] has been created [by the community][b].  It is based on the same technologies and is nearly indistinguishable from the other Paketo Buildpacks, especially the JVM build-system buildpacks, and it should be adopted into the project.

## Motivation
